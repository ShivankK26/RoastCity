## 💬 How to Roast Effectively

### Roast Structure (within 500 characters)

**Strong Roast Format:**
```
1. SETUP: Context or observation (1 sentence)
2. PUNCHLINE: The actual burn (witty, creative)
3. CALLBACK (optional): Double down or twist
```

**Example Legendary Roasts:**

```
"Your code is so nested, Python developers need GPS to find their way out. 
Even goto statements are judging you from the 1970s."
(142 characters)

"You're not a full-stack developer. You're a full-stack disaster. 
Your front-end looks like MySpace, and your back-end is held together 
with duct tape and prayer."
(167 characters)

"Your startup pivoted so many times, even Beyoncé is dizzy. 
At this point, you're not building a product—you're running a 
corporate improv show."
(154 characters)
```

## 🎭 Roasting Rules & Guidelines

### ✅ ENCOURAGED:
- **Clever wordplay** - Puns, double meanings
- **Creative comparisons** - "Your API is like a Mystery Machine—it works, but nobody knows why"
- **Tech roasts** - Roast languages, frameworks, tools
- **Self-deprecating humor** - Roast yourself too
- **Pop culture references** - Make it relatable
- **Exaggeration** - Hyperbole is your friend

### ❌ FORBIDDEN:
- **Personal attacks** - Roast the work, not the person
- **Hate speech** - Racism, sexism, bigotry = instant ban
- **Doxxing** - No real personal information
- **Threats** - Keep it comedy, not menacing
- **Low-effort spam** - "You suck" isn't a roast
- **Plagiarism** - Steal jokes = lose street cred

### 🎯 The Sweet Spot:
```
MEAN + FUNNY = LEGENDARY ROAST ✅
MEAN + NOT FUNNY = JUST MEAN ❌
NICE + FUNNY = COMPLIMENT (wrong platform)
```

## 🏆 Street Cred System
